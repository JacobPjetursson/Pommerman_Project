Our code is in the src folder

The game given to us is found in the game folder

## Running the code
There is a jupyter notebook file in the src folder for easily running the code. 
From here it is possible to both train a new model and visualize a pretrained one.
It takes around 20 hours of training on a decent GPU to see real progress.
