# Pommerman_Project

Our code is in the src folder

The Pommerman game itself (given to us) is found in the game folder

## Running the code
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the "game" folder. Run the command `pip install -U .` to install the Pommerman game.

There is a jupyter notebook file in the src folder for easily running the code. 
From here it is possible to both train a new model and visualize a pretrained one.
It takes around 20 hours of training on a decent GPU to see real progress.
