# Pommerman_Project

Our code is in the src folder

The Pommerman game itself (given to us) is found in the game folder

## Running the code
Go to [https://github.com/MultiAgentLearning/playground/tree/master/docs] and follow the guide there on installing the Pommerman game. You can use the game folder from this repository for installing.

There is a jupyter notebook file in the src folder for running the code. 
From here it is possible to both train a new model and visualize a pretrained one.
It takes around 20 hours of training on a decent GPU to see real progress.
